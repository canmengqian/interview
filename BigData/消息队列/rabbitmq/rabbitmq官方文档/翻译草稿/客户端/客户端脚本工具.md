# rabbitMQ命令行工具

## 概览

RabbitMQ 提供了一组相关的命令行工具:

- [rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmqctl.8.html) 用于服务管理和一般的操作任务
- [rabbitmq-diagnostics](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-diagnostics.8.html) : 用于问题诊断和健康检查
- [rabbitmq-plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-plugins.8.html) 用于[插件管理](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html)
- [rabbitmq-queues](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-queues.8.html) 用于维护队列任务，特别是[选举队列](https://www.rabbitmq.com/quorum-queues.html)
- [rabbitmq-upgrade](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-upgrade.8.html) 用于软件升级 [upgrades](https://www.rabbitmq.com/upgrade.html)

上述插件都位于sbin目录下,在windows下,这些插件以.bat结尾,以下插件是可选的,可以在github上被找到

- [rabbitmqadmin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management-cli.html) 通过 [HTTP API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html)来操作rabbitmq
- [rabbitmq-collect-env](https://github.com/rabbitmq/support-tools) :用于收集Cluster和环境信息,这个插件只能在linux环境下使用

Different tools cover different usage scenarios. For example, rabbitmqctl is usually only available to RabbitMQ administrator given that it provides full control over a node, including virtual host, user and permission management, destructive operations on node's data and so on.

rabbitmqadmin is built on top of the HTTP API and uses a different mechanism, and only requires that the [HTTP API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html) port is open for outside connections.

Even though CLI tools ship with the server, most commands [can be used to operate on remote nodes](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#remote-nodes). Plugins can [provide CLI commands](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#command-discovery) that will be discovered by CLI tools for explicitly enabled plugins.

## 命令行的使用帮助

为了了解命令是如何使用的,可以使用 help参数，以下写法都是生效的

```bash
rabbitmqctl help
rabbitmq-diagnostics help
rabbitmq-diagnostics help status
rabbitmqctl --help
```

## [rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#rabbitmqctl)

[rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmqctl.8.html)  更多偏向于管理性质的操作,包括以下功能

- 启停节点
- 访问节点状态,配置参数,健康检查
- 虚拟 host 管理
- 用户和权限管理
- Policy 管理
- 列出 队列(queues),TCP 连接(connections), 信道(channels),交换器( exchanges), 消费者(consumers)信息
- 集群成员管理

## [rabbitmq-plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#rabbitmq-plugins)

[rabbitmq-plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmq-plugins.8.html) is a tool that manages plugins: lists, enables and disables them. It ships with RabbitMQ.

It supports both online (when target node is running) and offline mode (changes take effect on node restart).

rabbitmq-plugins uses shared secret authentication (described below) with server nodes.

## [Authentication](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#authentication)

With the exception of rabbitmqadmin, RabbitMQ tools use a [shared secret authentication mechanism](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#erlang-cookie). This requires that [inter-node and CLI communication ports](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html) (by default) is open for external connections on the target node.

## [Using CLI Tools against Remote Server Nodes](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#remote-nodes)

CLI tools can be used to talk to remote nodes as well as the local ones. Nodes are identified by [node names](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#node-names). If no node name is specified, rabbit@{local hostname} is assumed to be the target. When contacting remote nodes, the same [authentication requirements](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#authentication) apply.

To contact a remote node, use the --node (-n) option that rabbitmqctl, rabbitmq-diagnostics and other core CLI tools accept. The following example contact the node rabbit@remote-host.local to find out its status:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics status -n rabbit@remote-host.local
```

Some commands, such as

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics status
```

can be used against any node. Others, such as

```bash
rabbitmqctl shutdown
```

or

```bash
rabbitmqctl wait
```

can only be run on the same host or in the same container as their target node. These commands typically rely on or modify something in the local environment, e.g. the local [enabled plugins file](https://www.rabbitmq.com/plugins.html).

### [Node Names](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#node-names)

RabbitMQ nodes are identified by node names. A node name consists of two parts, a prefix (usually rabbit) and hostname. For example, rabbit@node1.messaging.svc.local is a node name with the prefix of rabbit and hostname of node1.messaging.svc.local.

Node names in a cluster must be unique. If more than one node is running on a given host (this is usually the case in development and QA environments), they must use different prefixes, e.g. rabbit1@hostname and rabbit2@hostname.

CLI tools identify and address server nodes using node names. Most CLI commands are invoked against a node called target node. To specify a target node, use the --node (-n) option. For example, to run a [health check](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html) on node rabbit@warp10.local:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics -n rabbit@warp10 check_alarms
```

Some commands accept both a target node and another node name. For example, rabbitmqctl forget_cluster_node accepts both a target node (that will perform the action) and a name of the node to be removed.

In a cluster, nodes identify and contact each other using node names. See [Clustering guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering.html#node-names) for details.

When a node starts up, it checks whether it has been assigned a node name. This is done via the RABBITMQ_NODENAME [environment variable](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#supported-environment-variables). If no value was explicitly configured, the node resolves its hostname and prepends rabbit to it to compute its node name.

If a system uses fully qualified domain names (FQDNs) for hostnames, RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools must be configured to use so called long node names. For server nodes this is done by setting the RABBITMQ_USE_LONGNAME [environment variable](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html#supported-environment-variables) to true.

For CLI tools, either RABBITMQ_USE_LONGNAME must be set or the --longnames option must be specified:

```bash
# this example assumes that host1.messaging.eng.coolcorporation.banana is a hostname
# that successfully resolves
rabbitmq-diagnostics -n rabbit@host1.messaging.eng.coolcorporation.banana check_alarms --longnames
```

## [Options and Positional Arguments](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#passing-arguments)

RabbitMQ CLI tools largely follow existing, long established command line argument parsing conventions. This section provides some examples and focuses on edge cases and lesser known features.

Different commands take different arguments. Some are named options such as --node (aliased as -n), others are positional arguments, such as the username and password arguments in

```bash
rabbitmqctl add_user <username> <password>
```

A specific example:

```bash
rabbitmqctl add_user "a-user" "a-pa$$w0rd"
```

Options can be provided before or after positional arguments with one exception: anything that follows a double hyphen (--) will be treated as positional arguments:

```bash
# all values after the double hyphen (--) will be treated as positional arguments,
# even if they begin with a hyphen or a double hyphen
rabbitmqctl add_user --node rabbit@host1.messaging.eng.coolcorporation.banana -- "a-user" "a-pa$$w0rd"
```

The explicit positional argument separator must be used when positional arguments begin with a hyphen or a double hyphen (such as generated passwords), to make sure they are not parsed as options:

```bash
# Since "--!a-pa$$w0rd" is explicitly provided as a positional argument, it won't
# be mistakenly considered for an unsupported option, even though it starts with a double hyphen
rabbitmqctl add_user --node rabbit@host1.messaging.eng.coolcorporation.banana -- "a-user" "--!a-pa$$w0rd"
```

Option values can be passed as --option <value> or --option=<value>. The latter variant must be used when the value begins with a hyphen (-), otherwise it would be treated as an option:

```bash
# an alternative way of providing an option value
rabbitmqctl add_user --node=rabbit@host1.messaging.eng.coolcorporation.banana -- "a-user" "a-pa$$w0rd"
```

rabbitmqctl, rabbitmq-diagnostics, rabbitmq-plugins, and rabbitmq-queues support [command aliases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#aliases).

## [How CLI Tools Authenticate to Nodes (and Nodes to Each Other): the Erlang Cookie](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#erlang-cookie)

RabbitMQ nodes and CLI tools (with the exception of rabbitmqadmin) use a cookie to determine whether they are allowed to communicate with each other. For a CLI tool and a node to be able to communicate they must have the same shared secret called the Erlang cookie. The cookie is just a string of alphanumeric characters up to 255 characters in size. It is usually stored in a local file. The file must be only accessible to the owner (e.g. have UNIX permissions of 600 or similar). Every cluster node must have the same cookie.

If the file does not exist, Erlang VM will automatically create one with a randomly generated value when the RabbitMQ server starts up.

Erlang cookie generation should be done at cluster deployment stage, ideally using automation and orchestration tools.

### [Cookie File Locations](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#cookie-file-locations)

#### Linux, MacOS, *BSD

On UNIX systems, the cookie will be typically located in /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie (used by the server) and $HOME/.erlang.cookie (used by CLI tools). Note that since the value of $HOME varies from user to user, it's necessary to place a copy of the cookie file for each user that will be using the CLI tools. This applies to both non-privileged users and root.

RabbitMQ nodes will log its effective user's home directory location early on boot.

#### Community Docker Image and Kubernetes

[Docker community RabbitMQ image](https://github.com/docker-library/rabbitmq/) uses RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE environment variable value to populate the cookie file.

Configuration management and container orchestration tools that use this image must make sure that every RabbitMQ node container in a cluster uses the same value.

In the context of Kubernetes, the value must be specified in the [deployment file](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/). For instance, this can be seen in the [RabbitMQ on Kubernetes examples repository](https://github.com/rabbitmq/diy-kubernetes-examples).

#### Windows

On Windows, the cookie location depends on a few factors:

- Whether the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables are both set
- Erlang version: prior to 20.2 (these are no longer supported by any [maintained release series of RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/versions.html)) or 20.2 and later

##### Erlang 20.2 or later

With Erlang versions starting with 20.2, the cookie file locations are:

- %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.erlang.cookie (usually C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.erlang.cookie for user %USERNAME%) if both the HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH environment variables are set
- %USERPROFILE%\.erlang.cookie (usually C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.erlang.cookie) if HOMEDRIVE and HOMEPATH are not both set
- For the RabbitMQ Windows service - %USERPROFILE%\.erlang.cookie (usually C:\WINDOWS\system32\config\systemprofile)

If the Windows service is used, the cookie should be copied from C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile\.erlang.cookie to the expected location for users running commands like rabbitmqctl.bat.

### Overriding Using CLI and Runtime Command Line Arguments

As an alternative, the option "-setcookie <value>" can be added to RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS [environment variable value](https://www.rabbitmq.com/configure.html) to override the cookie value used by a RabbitMQ node:

```bash
RABBITMQ_SERVER_ADDITIONAL_ERL_ARGS="-setcookie cookie-value"
```

CLI tools can take a cookie value using a command line flag:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics status --erlang-cookie "cookie-value"
```

Both are **the least secure options** and generally **not recommended**.

### [Troubleshooting](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#cookie-file-troubleshooting) Cookie-based Authentication

#### CLI Tools

Starting with [version 3.8.6](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html), rabbitmq-diagnostics includes a command that provides relevant information on the Erlang cookie file used by CLI tools:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics erlang_cookie_sources
```

The command will report on the effective user, user home directory and the expected location of the cookie file:

```plaintext
Cookie File

Effective user: antares
Effective home directory: /home/cli-user
Cookie file path: /home/cli-user/.erlang.cookie
Cookie file exists? true
Cookie file type: regular
Cookie file access: read
Cookie file size: 20

Cookie CLI Switch

--erlang-cookie value set? false
--erlang-cookie value length: 0

Env variable  (Deprecated)

RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE value set? false
RABBITMQ_ERLANG_COOKIE value length: 0
```

#### Server Nodes

When a node starts, it will [log](https://www.rabbitmq.com/logging.html) the home directory location of its effective user:

```plaintext
node           : rabbit@cdbf4de5f22d
home dir       : /var/lib/rabbitmq
```

Unless any [server directories](https://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html) were overridden, that's the directory where the cookie file will be looked for, and created by the node on first boot if it does not already exist.

In the example above, the cookie file location will be /var/lib/rabbitmq/.erlang.cookie.

#### Hostname Resolution

Starting with [RabbitMQ 3.8.6](https://www.rabbitmq.com/changelog.html), CLI tools provide two commands that help verify that hostname resolution on a node works as expected. The commands are not meant to replace [dig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dig_(command)) and other specialised DNS tools but rather provide a way to perform most basic checks while taking [Erlang runtime hostname resolver features](https://erlang.org/doc/apps/erts/inet_cfg.html) into account.

The commands are covered in the [Networking guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html#dns-verify-resolution).

## [Authentication Failures](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#cli-authentication-failures)

When the cookie is misconfigured (for example, not identical), RabbitMQ nodes will log errors such as "Connection attempt from disallowed node", "", "Could not auto-cluster".

For example, when a CLI tool connects and tries to authenticate using a mismatching secret value:

```plaintext
2020-06-15 13:03:33 [error] <0.1187.0> ** Connection attempt from node 'rabbitmqcli-99391-rabbit@warp10' rejected. Invalid challenge reply. **
```

When a CLI tool such as rabbitmqctl fails to authenticate with RabbitMQ, the message usually says

```plaintext
* epmd reports node 'rabbit' running on port 25672
* TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed
* suggestion: hostname mismatch?
* suggestion: is the cookie set correctly?
* suggestion: is the Erlang distribution using TLS?
```

This means that TCP connection from a CLI tool to a RabbitMQ node succeeded but authentication attempt was rejected by the server. The message also mentions several most common reasons for that, which are covered next.

#### Possible Reason 1: Misplaced or Missing Cookie File

An incorrectly placed cookie file or cookie value mismatch are most common scenarios for such failures.

RabbitMQ node logs its cookie hash on start. CLI tools print their cookie hash value when they fail to authenticate with the target node.

When a recent Erlang/OTP version is used, authentication failures contain more information and cookie mismatches can be identified better:

```plaintext
rabbit@warp10:
  * connected to epmd (port 4369) on warp10
  * epmd reports node 'rabbit' running on port 25672
  * TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed

  * Authentication failed (rejected by the remote node), please check the Erlang cookie

current node details:
- node name: 'rabbitmq-cli-63@warp10'
- home dir: /home/username
- cookie hash: Sg08R8+G85EYHZ3H/9NUfg==
```

#### Possible Reason 2: Node Name Type Mismatch

If RabbitMQ nodes are configured to use long node names (RABBITMQ_USE_LONGNAME is exported to true), so should CLI tools via the same environment variable or the --longnames command line flag introduced in 3.7.0.

#### Possible Reason 3: Inter-node Connections Require TLS

If RabbitMQ is set up to [encrypt inter-node and CLI connections using TLS](https://www.rabbitmq.com/clustering-ssl.html), CLI tools also must use TLS and therefore require additional options. Non-TLS connections from other nodes and CLI tools will fail.

#### Possible Reason 4: Hostname Mismatch

Other reasons include a hostname mismatch in node name used by the target RabbitMQ node and that provided to the CLI tool (e.g. via the -n flag). For example, if a node runs using rabbit@rmq1.eng.megacorp.local as its name but rabbitmqctl is invoked as

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics status -n rabbit@rmq-dev.eng.megacorp.local
```

then even if rmq-dev.eng.megacorp.local and rmq1.eng.megacorp.local resolve to the same IP address, the server will reject rabbitmqctl's authentication attempt. This scenario is relatively rare.

When a recent Erlang/OTP version is used, authentication failures contain more information and hostname mismatches can be identified better:

```plaintext
rabbit@localhost:
  * connected to epmd (port 4369) on localhost
  * epmd reports node 'rabbit' running on port 25672
  * TCP connection succeeded but Erlang distribution failed

  * Hostname mismatch: node "rabbit@warp10" believes its host is different. Please ensure that hostnames resolve the same way locally and on "rabbit@warp10"


current node details:
- node name: 'rabbitmq-cli-30@warp10'
- home dir: /Users/antares
- cookie hash: Sg08R8+G85EYHZ3H/9NUfg==
```

#### Other Possible Reasons

Just like with any network connection, CLI-to-node connections can fail due to

- Hostname resolution failures
- Incorrect IP routing
- TCP port access blocked (firewalls, etc)

and so on.

[RabbitMQ Networking guide](https://www.rabbitmq.com/networking.html) contains a section on troubleshooting of networking-related issues.

## [rabbitmqadmin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#http-api-cli)

[rabbitmqadmin](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management-cli.html) is a command line tool that's built on top of [RabbitMQ HTTP API](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html). It is not a replacement for rabbitmqctl and provides access to a subset of most commonly performed operations provided by the [management UI](https://www.rabbitmq.com/management.html).

The tool requires Python 2.7.9 or a more recent version.

rabbitmqadmin uses HTTP API authentication mechanism (basic HTTP authentication). It has to be downloaded separately from a running node or [GitHub](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/blob/master/deps/rabbitmq_management/bin/rabbitmqadmin).

## ["Node-local" and "Clusterwide" Commands](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#cli-and-clustering)

Client connections, channels and queues will be distributed across cluster nodes. Operators need to be able to inspect and [monitor](https://www.rabbitmq.com/monitoring.html) such resources across all cluster nodes.

CLI tools such as [rabbitmqctl](https://www.rabbitmq.com/rabbitmqctl.8.html) and rabbitmq-diagnostics provide commands that inspect resources and cluster-wide state. Some commands focus on the state of a single node (e.g. rabbitmq-diagnostics environment and rabbitmq-diagnostics status), others inspect cluster-wide state. Some examples of the latter include rabbitmqctl list_connections, rabbitmqctl list_mqtt_connections, rabbitmqctl list_stomp_connections, rabbitmqctl list_users, rabbitmqctl list_vhosts and so on.

Such "cluster-wide" commands will often contact one node first, discover cluster members and contact them all to retrieve and combine their respective state. For example, rabbitmqctl list_connections will contact all nodes, retrieve their AMQP 0-9-1 and AMQP 1.0 connections, and display them all to the user. The user doesn't have to manually contact all nodes.

Assuming a non-changing state of the cluster (e.g. no connections are closed or opened), two CLI commands executed against two different nodes one after another will produce identical or semantically identical results. "Node-local" commands, however, likely will not produce identical results since two nodes rarely have entirely identical state.

## [Commands Provided by Plugins](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#command-discovery)

A RabbitMQ plugin can provide CLI commands that will be discovered by tools such as rabbitmq-diagnostics, rabbitmq-queues, rabbitmqctl, and others. For plugin commands to be discoverable, the plugin **must be explicitly enabled**.

When performing command discovery, CLI tools will consult the [Enabled Plugins File](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#enabled-plugins-file) to determine what plugins to scan for commands. If a plugin is not included into that file, e.g. because it was enabled implicitly as a dependency, it won't be listed in the enabled plugins file and thus its CLI commands **will not be discovered** and will not be available.

Use the help command to see what commands are available, both core and provided by plugins.

## [Command Aliases](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html#aliases)

rabbitmqctl, rabbitmq-diagnostics and rabbitmq-plugins support command aliases. Aliases provide a way to define abbreviated versions of certain commands and their arguments. For example, instead of typing rabbitmqctl environment it may be more convenient to define an alias, rabbitmqctl env, that would expand to rabbitmqctl environment.

Aliases are loaded from a file specified via the RABBITMQ_CLI_ALIASES_FILE environment variable:

```bash
export RABBITMQ_CLI_ALIASES_FILE=/path/to/cli_aliases.conf
```

The aliases file uses a very minimalistic ini-style alias = command format, for example:

```ini
env = environment
st  = status --quiet

lp  = list_parameters --quiet
lq  = list_queues --quiet
lu  = list_users --quiet

cs  = cipher_suites --openssl-format --quiet
```

With this alias file in place it will be possible to use

```bash
rabbitmqctl env
```

which would expand to

```bash
rabbitmqctl environment
```

or

```bash
rabbitmqctl lq
```

which would expand to

```bash
rabbitmqctl list_queues --quiet
```

The last alias in the example above configures a rabbitmq-diagnostics command:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics cs
```

would expand to

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics cipher_suites --openssl-format --quiet
```

All tools process aliases the same way. As long as the expanded command is recognized, aliases can be used with any tool or even more than one. For example, both rabbitmqctl and rabbitmq-diagnostics provide the environment command so the env alias works for both of them exactly the same way:

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics env
```

would expand to

```bash
rabbitmq-diagnostics environment
```

The file will be consulted only if the command invoked is not provided by the tool.
